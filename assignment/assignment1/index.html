    # Week 4 - Assignment 1

    ## Introduction

    We've got some interesting school data that we're working with. In addition
    to displaying it on the map, we also want to show it in a list. Notice that
    our project has an html element, .sidebar, that contains no content. We
    are going to fill it with filtering functionality and a list of schools.

    ## Build components with HTML and (minimal!) CSS

    Take a look at the image screen-assignment.png. Add HTML inside of the
    element <div class="sidebar"></div> and add CSS inside the file
    css/style.css to recreate this content in the browser. You do not need to
    create the list of schools dynamically using the data—just hardcode
    three schools (in a future assignment, we will generate the list with
    the same data that we use to generate markers on our map!).

    Note: the blue part of the select input in screen-assignment.png is the
    default styling for Chrome on OSX—you do not need to change the styling of
    this element to match exactly, just go with the default style on your system.
    You should be able to do most styling for this assignment with the CSS
    properties `margin`, `padding`, `font-weight`, `font-size`, `background-color`,
    and `color`. Positioning the "Hide filters" button is a little trickier:
    Look into `float` or absolute positioning, but feel free to try out
    a different approach. If you find yourself struggling, remember to seek
    help on stackoverflow and the class gitter - we haven't covered CSS at
    this point but will look more closely in future classes

    ## Stretch Goal: Make it look cool

    Try changing the colors. Make it look a little different. There
    is no right answer here: just try something and make it your own. Take a
    look at neat websites on https://www.typewolf.com/ or http://www.awwwards.com/
    for color or styling inspiration.
